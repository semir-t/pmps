Learning material and examples for course AR207 at FE Tuzla
# Software requirements
There are two approaches that can be used for compiling the firmware:
1. Using the Makefile
2. Using the STMCubeIDE application (https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html)

Provided examples are equipped with dedicated Makefile and STMCubeIDE project file. This means that any example can be compiled using the above approach.

# Hardware requirements
For this course we will need following components:
- STM32F407 Disco Board (https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32f4discovery.html)
- USB 2.0 to TTL UART Serial Converter CP2102 (https://www.ebay.com/itm/1PCS-6Pin-USB-2-0-to-TTL-UART-Serial-Converter-CP2102-STC-Replace-Ft232/284022352349?hash=item42210d29dd:g:1y4AAOSwLTZfbBhs)
- Wire jumpers [MM,FF,MF] (https://www.ebay.com/itm/40PCS-20cm-2-54MM-FF-FM-MM-Dupont-wire-jumper-cables-male-to-female-For-Arduino/312724733910?hash=item48cfd8bfd6:g:05sAAOSwlbZdSZ6E)
